# Push BrainSafe AI to a Hugging Face Space.
#
# Run this yourself: it needs a Hugging Face access token, which is a credential and is not something
# to hand to an assistant. Create one at https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens with WRITE scope, and
# let git prompt you for it, or use the huggingface-cli login flow. Do not paste it into a file.
#
# What this does that a plain push does not: the model binaries are excluded by .gitignore, so a
# normal push deploys an application with no models. They are force-added here and tracked with
# git-lfs, in the Space clone only, because the GitHub repository's free LFS quota is 1 GB and the
# binaries are 0.78 GB.
