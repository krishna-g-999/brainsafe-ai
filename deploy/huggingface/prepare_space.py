"""Assemble a Hugging Face Space directory containing exactly what the server needs.

Copying the repository wholesale is the usual way this goes wrong. It carries the 155 MB of
scaffold-hold-out twins, the reviewer package, the manuscript figures and the validation artefacts,
none of which serve a prediction, and the upload is then several times larger than it has to be for
no benefit.

This copies the runtime set, writes the Space card and the git-LFS rules, and reports the size. It
does not push: pushing is a credentialled act and belongs to whoever owns the Space.

Run:  python deploy/huggingface/prepare_space.py --out ../brainsafe-space
