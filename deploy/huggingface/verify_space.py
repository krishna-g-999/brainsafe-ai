"""Does an assembled Space run on its own, or does it lean on the repository it was built from?

Assembling a directory and reading the file list proves nothing. The failure this exists to catch is
a path that resolves during local testing because the repository happens to be importable, and then
fails on the Space where it is not. A missing data file behaves the same way: silently absent, and
discovered by the first visitor rather than by us.

The check therefore runs with the Space as the working directory and the repository's own source
roots removed from sys.path, then exercises what a first query touches: every model loaded, a
prediction made, the applicability domain assessed, and the novelty-strata table read, since the
interface quotes an expected recall from it and would drop that row without comment if it were
absent.

The repository's virtualenv is deliberately left on the path. site-packages lives inside the
repository directory, so removing everything under it would fail the import for a reason that has
nothing to do with whether the Space is self-contained.
