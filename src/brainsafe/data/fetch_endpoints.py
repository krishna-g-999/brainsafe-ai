"""Retrieve the measured ChEMBL activities for the core target panel, and the B3DB BBB set.

This is the first step of the endpoint pipeline and the origin of the core training data. It was
written as BS_fetch_endpoints.py, archived in commit fea5029 and restored here, because
data/raw/measured_endpoints_SOURCE.md cites it as the retriever for both sources and the chain from
public database to training table was otherwise unreproducible.

What it does now, and what it deliberately no longer does. The original wrote
data/endpoints/<target>.csv directly, from ChEMBL alone. Those tables are now produced by
rebuild_endpoints.py, which pools ChEMBL with BindingDB at the compound level; writing them here
would silently replace the pooled tables with ChEMBL-only ones. This script therefore stops at the
cache, which is what rebuild_endpoints.py consumes. BBB is different and is still written here,
because B3DB is its only source and nothing else produces it.

Query and labelling are unchanged from the archived version, so a regenerated cache matches the one
the shipped tables were built from: activities with a non-null pchembl_value, standard_type in
IC50/Ki/Kd/EC50/Potency, per-compound median potency and earliest document_year taken downstream.
ChEMBL assigns a pchembl_value only where standard_relation is '=', so censored measurements are
excluded by that query rather than silently treated as exact. They are not discarded: a second query
retrieves the '>' records, which are the measured non-binders, and keeps those whose bound settles
the compound as inactive whatever the true value is. Excluding them by construction is why most of
this panel is over 90 per cent active.

Outputs:
  data/_chembl_cache/<target>_y.json          exact activities, consumed by rebuild_endpoints.py
  data/_chembl_cache/<target>_inactive.json   measured non-binders, pooled in as label 0
  data/endpoints/BBB.csv                      smiles,label from B3DB classification

Run:  python src/brainsafe/data/fetch_endpoints.py
      python src/brainsafe/data/fetch_endpoints.py --refresh   (ignore existing caches and refetch)

    ChEMBL assigns a pchembl_value only where standard_relation is '=', so a query filtered on

    Those records are not missing data, they are the measured negative class, and dropping them is
    why most endpoints in this panel are over 90 per cent active and five have fewer than 25
    inactives. For AChE alone the filter discards 2,210 measured inactives.

    This asks for the complement: standard_relation '>' with a concentration in nM. The bound is
    converted to a potency bound, and only records whose bound is at or below the inactive cut are
    usable, because those are inactive whatever the true value is. A ">100 nM" record bounds potency
    at pX 7 and is consistent with active or inactive, so it is counted and discarded rather than
