"""Verified HTTPS on a network whose interception certificate is malformed but trusted.

The problem this solves, precisely. Some institutional networks terminate TLS with their own CA,
installed in the machine's trust store by an administrator. Python 3.13 enables
`ssl.VERIFY_X509_STRICT` by default, which enforces RFC 5280 formatting on every certificate in the
chain, and some of these CAs do not mark `basicConstraints` critical as the RFC requires. The chain
builds, the signatures verify, the hostname matches, and the handshake is then refused over a
formatting rule.

What this module does, and what it deliberately does not do. It builds a trust store from certifi
plus the certificates the operating system already trusts, and clears one verification flag:
`VERIFY_X509_STRICT`. Everything else stays on. Measured against `www.ebi.ac.uk` on the network this
was written for:

    certifi only,  strict ON   FAIL  unable to get local issuer certificate
    OS store,      strict ON   FAIL  Basic Constraints of CA cert not marked critical
    OS store,      strict OFF  OK    peer verified
    certifi only,  strict OFF  FAIL  unable to get local issuer certificate

The fourth line is the one that matters. With strictness cleared but the OS store absent, an
unknown certificate is still refused. Chain building, signature verification, validity dates and
hostname checking all remain in force, so this is not `verify=False`: an attacker still needs a key
chaining to a CA an administrator installed on this machine. `verify=False` would need none of that,
and would let anyone on the path substitute a molecule and have the tool report on it confidently.
That is recorded as BS-M-25 in the audit and is not what happens here.

It is opt-in, because silently relaxing a verification default is how these things become invisible.
Set BRAINSAFE_ALLOW_NONSTRICT_TLS=1 to enable it; without that the session verifies normally and
fails on such a network, which is the correct default.
