"""Gather the clinical CNS precedent reference: ATC class N molecules that reached a clinical phase.

Written as BS_fetch_clinical.py, archived in commit fea5029 and restored here, because
data/clinical_cns_reference.csv is a live input (build_compound_library.py, build_endpoint_context.py)
and had no reproducible origin once the script was removed.

What this is, and what it is not. Every row is a molecule that a regulator or sponsor advanced to a
declared clinical phase, with its ATC codes mapped to the disease area the panel scores. It records
clinical precedent, which is measured. It is not an efficacy label and no model is trained on it; it
exists so that a predicted profile can be set beside what has actually been taken into humans for
that indication. Target engagement is not efficacy, and this file is the reminder of the gap rather
than a bridge across it.

Outputs:
  data/clinical_cns_reference.csv    name,smiles,max_phase,atc,disease

Run:  python src/brainsafe/data/fetch_clinical.py
