"""Build endpoint tables for targets added to close the natural-product gap.

Three targets are added, chosen on mechanism rather than on data volume. The survey found 58 new
trainable targets, most of which have nothing to do with the brain: Geminin, apurinic site lyase and
prelamin-A/C all carry more measured natural-product activity than any of the three taken here, and
adding them would dilute a CNS panel with replication and DNA-repair biology to make a count larger.

  NRF2      Q16236   the effector of the KEAP1-NRF2 axis already modelled. KEAP1 is the sensor and
                     was in the panel alone, so the arm that natural products are most often reported
                     to act on had no readout. This is the withanolide mechanism.
  NFKB1     P19838   the canonical inflammatory transcription factor, joining NLRP3 and RIPK1 on a
                     neuroinflammation axis that already exists in the disease graph.
  NR3C1     P04150   the glucocorticoid receptor, on the stress and depression axis. The smallest of
                     the three but the best balanced, and the richest in the sp3 chemistry the panel
                     lacks.

Labels come from the project's existing rule, censored bounds included, so these tables are built the
same way as every other endpoint and carry the same meaning. Structures are deduplicated on the
InChIKey of the desalted parent, because two records of one compound written differently would
otherwise enter as two.

This writes tables only. Training is a separate command, and the tables should be inspected first:
each one is a new scientific claim about what the panel measures.

Output: data/endpoints/<NAME>.csv, in the schema every other endpoint uses
        results/tables/np_endpoints_built.csv

    Written because the first explanation offered for why these three endpoints failed, that their
    activity is recorded in cell-based reporter assays, was checked against the NPASS metadata and

    NRF2 records. What the metadata does support is this table. A direct binding constant, Ki or Kd,
    is what a fingerprint-based binder classifier is fitted to reproduce, and for two of the three
