"""Measured natural-product activity against the panel targets, fetched and characterised.

Why this exists. A withanolide submitted to the server returns no engagement and a maximum Tanimoto
of 0.31 to 158,890 measured compounds, with the nearest neighbour a bile acid. That is honest
behaviour on chemistry the panel does not cover, and the coverage gap is measurable: the training
library has a median fraction-sp3 of 0.36 against 0.79 for withaferin A, and only 3.3 per cent of it
is both sp3-rich and free of aromatic rings.

The repository already holds 214,740 COCONUT natural products, but a decision recorded on 2026-07-20
placed them as coverage and never as training labels, because they carry structures and no measured
endpoint values; using them as labels would reintroduce the circularity the project removed. That
decision stands. This script does not touch them.

What it adds instead is natural-product chemistry that DOES carry measured activity against the
panel's own targets, drawn from ChEMBL, so it enters training under exactly the same rule as every
other row: a measurement, against a named target, with its relation preserved.

Two cautions are built in.

  the flag is not trusted   ChEMBL's natural_product field means natural-product-derived and is
                            over-inclusive: querying it returns prazosin, a synthetic quinazoline,
                            as its first record. Every fetched compound is therefore characterised
                            structurally (fraction sp3, aromatic ring count, ring system) and the
                            report separates genuinely terpenoid or steroidal chemistry from
                            flat semi-synthetic scaffolds that the panel already covers.
  nothing is merged here    this writes a review table and a coverage report. Merging into the
                            endpoint tables is a separate, deliberate act, because it changes every
                            model downstream and must be measured before and after.

Outputs:
  data/_chembl_cache/np_<target>.json          raw activities, as retrieved
  results/tables/natural_product_candidates.csv   one row per compound-target measurement
  results/tables/natural_product_coverage.csv     per-target summary, and what it would add
