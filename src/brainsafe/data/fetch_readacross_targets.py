"""Fetch additional targets to widen read-across beyond the modelled panel.

Read-across answers a query by pointing at measured neighbours, so its reach is set by how much of
pharmacology the index covers, not by how many models are trained. Adding measured actives for
targets we do not model therefore extends the tool's coverage without any claim that those targets
are predicted.

Every identifier below was checked by querying the target record and confirming the returned
preferred name describes the intended protein. That check was not decorative: of twenty-six
identifiers recalled from memory, four pointed at unrelated proteins, with the histamine H4 entry
resolving to the delta opioid receptor and the CDK5 entry to CDK9. Those were dropped rather than
corrected by guesswork, and only name-verified entries appear here.

These compounds enter the read-across index alone. They train nothing, and the interface labels
their evidence as similarity to measured actives rather than as prediction.

Output: data/readacross/<TARGET>.csv
