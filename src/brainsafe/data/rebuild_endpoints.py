"""Rebuild the endpoint training tables from pooled ChEMBL + BindingDB measured evidence.

For each target the two independent measured sources are combined at the compound level: each source
contributes a per-compound median potency (on the shared -log10 molar scale), the two are pooled by
InChIKey, and the label is derived with the unchanged rule (>=6 active, <5 inactive, 5-6 grey zone
dropped). Blood-brain-barrier data additionally gains the FDA-curated compounds that are not already
in B3DB. Nothing is imputed and no source overrides a measurement; where both sources measure a
compound, their medians are pooled.

The current tables are copied to a timestamped folder under archive/legacy/ first, so the change is
reversible and the provenance of every compound (which source, how many) is recorded.

This script rewrites the training data, so it refuses to run on incomplete inputs. Every cached
source response is checked before anything is touched, every table is rebuilt in memory and checked
for plausibility before any file is written, and a rebuild that would empty or halve a table stops
with a non-zero exit. On a fresh clone the caches are absent (they are not committed), and the
correct outcome is a clear error, not eleven empty tables.

Outputs:
  data/endpoints/<target>.csv        smiles,label,pchembl,year,source   (rebuilt)
  results/tables/endpoint_rebuild_provenance.csv   per-endpoint source breakdown

Run:  python src/brainsafe/data/rebuild_endpoints.py
      python src/brainsafe/data/rebuild_endpoints.py --allow-shrink   (only if a drop is intended)
