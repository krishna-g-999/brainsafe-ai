"""Package the raw API caches as one citable archive, with a manifest that can verify them.

The caches under data/_chembl_cache, data/_bindingdb_cache and data/_pubchem_cache are the only
record of what ChEMBL, BindingDB and PubChem returned on the retrieval dates. They are committed to
the repository, so a clone can rebuild the endpoint tables without a network call. This script
publishes the same bytes a second way, as an archive to deposit alongside the model release, for two
reasons: the deposit is citable and versioned in a way a git directory is not, and a reader who wants
only the source data should not have to clone a repository to get it.

The manifest is the point, exactly as it is for the models. It records the archive's SHA-256 and the
size and checksum of every file inside, so a copy can be verified rather than trusted. Because the
caches are also in git, the manifest doubles as an integrity check on the working tree: --verify
compares what is on disk against what was published and reports any file that has drifted.

Writes caches_manifest.json (committed) and dist/brainsafe_source_caches_v<version>.tar.gz (not).

Run:  python src/brainsafe/data/package_caches.py
      python src/brainsafe/data/package_caches.py --verify   (check the tree against the manifest)
