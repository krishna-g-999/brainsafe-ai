"""What does every DEPLOYED binder model do when shown chemistry it has no business recognising?

Two gaps in the existing evidence made this necessary.

The background-specificity calibration bounds the false-positive rate on a random sample of the
measured training library. That library is drug-like medicinal chemistry, so it is a weak test: a
model can pass it and still fire on a sugar. The inversion test H7 did use genuinely random PubChem
structures, but it scored the scaffold hold-out twins rather than the models the web server actually
serves, so its false-positive rates describe a model no user ever meets.

This closes both. Every deployed binder model is scored at its deployed threshold against the 600
random PubChem structures drawn for H4, and against a small set of molecules that no CNS target
plausibly binds: glucose, urea, acetate, ethanol and similar. A model calling urea a sodium-channel
binder is not a marginal calibration issue. It is a false-positive generator inside a tool whose
stated purpose is to stop laboratories spending money on compounds that will not work.

The trivial-control list is deliberately not chemistry any of these models was trained on, and is
small enough to be read individually rather than summarised away.
