"""Which reported results are still true of the model that is deployed?

This project has changed a great deal in a short time: endpoints added, two withdrawn, thresholds
corrected, a gating rule changed. Every one of those changes can silently invalidate a number sitting
in a results file, and a stale number in a results file becomes a stale number in a manuscript. The
coverage panel had already drifted into advertising a withdrawn endpoint before a check caught it;
there is no reason to assume it was the only thing that drifted.

This compares every result artefact against the deployed state and reports three kinds of problem:

  stale       the file names endpoints that no longer exist, or is older than the models it describes
  incomplete  the file omits endpoints that are now deployed, so any aggregate it reports is over a
              different panel than the one running
  contradicts a metric in the file disagrees with the same metric computed from the deployed models

It does not fix anything. The point is a list of what must be regenerated before the manuscript is
final, produced mechanically rather than from memory of what was run when.
