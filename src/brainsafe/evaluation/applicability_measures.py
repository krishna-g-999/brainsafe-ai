"""Which applicability-domain measure actually separates chemistry the panel cannot place?

The deployed measure is the maximum Tanimoto similarity to the endpoint's own measured chemistry,
and it fails the one adversarial check written to test it: shown sugars, fatty acids, buffers and
simple inorganic acids, it scores them a median 0.48 against 0.44 for approved drugs the model has
never seen. It rates non-drug-like chemistry as *better* placed than real drugs.

The reason is structural rather than a bug. A maximum over a folded fingerprint rewards being a
substructure of something in the training set. A hexadecanoic acid is a long alkyl chain with a
carboxylate, and both fragments appear in thousands of medicinal-chemistry compounds, so its single
best match is high while it resembles no training compound as a whole. Maximum similarity asks "is
any part of you familiar", when the question that matters is "do you sit among compounds we have
measured".

Four alternatives are measured here against the same adversarial set, all on the same fingerprints,
so the comparison is between definitions rather than between implementations:

  max              the deployed measure, as a baseline
  mean_top5        mean similarity to the five nearest training compounds. A compound genuinely
                   inside the domain has a neighbourhood, not one lucky match
  kth_5            similarity to the fifth nearest neighbour alone, the strictest form of the same
                   idea
  density_0.4      how many training compounds sit within Tanimoto 0.4, which measures support
                   directly rather than by proxy

A measure passes if non-drug-like chemistry scores below unseen drugs, one-sided Mann-Whitney
p < 0.01, and if it flags a useful share of the aliens at a threshold that does not also reject the
drugs. Both halves matter: a measure that flags everything separates nothing.
