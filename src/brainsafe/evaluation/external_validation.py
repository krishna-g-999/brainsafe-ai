"""External validation of the trained models on data held entirely out of training.

Two independent checks:

  1. Blood-brain barrier on approved drugs. The deployed BBB model (trained on B3DB) is applied to the
     306 FDA-curated compounds that are *not* in B3DB. Because the model never saw them, this is a
     genuine external test on approved drugs, the population a reviewer cares about most.

  2. DrugBank applicability. The eight classifiers are applied to the 11,723 DrugBank small molecules
     to show the fraction the models flag as active per endpoint - a sanity check on behaviour over a
     broad, unlabelled approved/experimental drug library (no labels exist, so this is descriptive,
     not a performance claim).

Outputs:
  results/tables/external_bbb_validation.csv     metrics on the 306 novel approved-drug BBB compounds
  results/tables/drugbank_screen_summary.csv     predicted-active fraction per endpoint on DrugBank

Run:  python src/brainsafe/evaluation/external_validation.py
