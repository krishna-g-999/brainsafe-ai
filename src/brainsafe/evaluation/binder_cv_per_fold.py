"""Per-fold ten-fold cross-validation for the binder panel.

The binder models were cross-validated at training time, ten-fold, grouped on Bemis-Murcko scaffold,
and each endpoint's out-of-fold AUROC is recorded in models_rf/binder_modes.json. What was not kept
was the detail behind that single number: the individual folds, their sizes, and the conventional
random split for comparison. A reviewer asking to see the ten-fold results is asking for exactly that
detail, so this recomputes it and writes every fold out.

Reconstructing the training set
-------------------------------
A binder endpoint's training set is not its CSV. It is the measured actives (pChEMBL >= 7), a decoy
set drawn from background chemistry, and half the measured inactives; the other half is held out for
threshold calibration and never trained on. This script rebuilds that composition by the same rule,
with a seed derived from the endpoint name so each is independent and reproducible.

Because the decoys are redrawn rather than restored, these folds are an independent re-run of the
training protocol, not a replay of the original run. That is the stronger test: if the recorded
training-time AUROC and this re-run disagree, the endpoint's score depends on which decoys it drew,
which is worth knowing. The comparison is written out as `recorded_scaffold_cv_auroc` alongside the
re-run mean so the two can be read against each other.

Endpoints trained on measured labels alone are cross-validated on those labels directly, with no
decoys involved.

Outputs
  results/tables/binder_cv_folds.csv     one row per endpoint x split x fold
  results/tables/binder_cv_summary.csv   mean and sd per endpoint x split, with the recorded value

Resumable: endpoints already present in the folds file are skipped, so an interrupted run continues.
