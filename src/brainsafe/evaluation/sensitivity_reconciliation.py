"""Reconcile the four figures this project reports for deployed sensitivity.

Four artefacts report "sensitivity at the deployed threshold" for the binder panel and they do not
agree. A thesis audit traced the disagreement to the sets they are measured on, and one of them is
not the set its own label claims.

  results/tables/final_thresholds.csv        held-out actives only, from models_rf/holdout/*.json
  results/tables/background_specificity.csv  every active in the endpoint table, training included
  models_rf/binder_modes.json                whatever the last writer put there
  inversion/results/H7_*.csv                 held-out actives scored against random PubChem

The threshold sequence runs final_thresholds.py and then calibrate_background_specificity.py, and
both write `sensitivity_at_threshold` into the registry. The second wins. But the second selects its
actives with

    act = df.loc[p >= 7, "smiles"]

over the whole endpoint table, so the model is scored on the compounds it was fitted on, while the
registry still carries `sensitivity_basis: "held_out_actives_by_scaffold"` written by the first. The
published mean of 0.898 is therefore measured on a set that is mostly training data and labelled as
though it were not.

This script quantifies the gap per endpoint rather than asserting it: for each deployed binder it
reports the held-out figure, the published figure, and what fraction of the published figure's
scoring set the model was trained on.
