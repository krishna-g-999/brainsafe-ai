"""Prospective validation: what would this panel have said about chemistry that did not yet exist?

External validation is the thinnest part of this project's evidence, and the reason is structural
rather than neglect. An external test set must be measured chemistry absent from training, and for
most of these targets the public measured chemistry *is* the training set. Buying a genuinely
independent set would mean running new assays.

There is one axis along which an independent set can still be constructed from what exists, and it
is the axis that matters most for a server people will submit new compounds to: time. Every measured
row carries the year of the document it came from. Freezing the data at a year, fitting the panel on
what was known then, and testing on compounds first published afterwards reproduces the situation a
user is actually in. It is the accepted simulator of prospective performance (Sheridan, J Chem Inf
Model 2013), and it is stronger evidence than a random split because a compound published after the
cutoff was not available to be memorised, whatever its scaffold.

What makes this a real test rather than a comfortable one:

  The models are refitted. Scoring the deployed models on post-cutoff compounds would measure
  nothing, because the deployed models were fitted on them. Every endpoint here is trained again
  from its pre-cutoff rows alone.

  The operating point is also frozen. A threshold tuned on the full data leaks the future into the
  decision even when the model does not. Thresholds here are quantiles of pre-cutoff held-out
  measured inactives, so the reported sensitivity is what a user in the cutoff year would have got.

  Decoys are matched to pre-cutoff actives only, and every post-cutoff compound is barred from decoy
  eligibility, so a test compound can never appear as a training negative.

  Nothing else changes. Same featuriser, same forest, same calibration, same target false-positive
  rate as the deployed panel, so the difference between these numbers and the deployed ones is the
  cost of not knowing the future and nothing else.

The headline number is not the point. A time split flatters a field that publishes analogue series:
if the compounds appearing after the cutoff are close relatives of those before it, high performance
demonstrates interpolation and not much else. Every test compound is therefore scored for its
maximum Tanimoto similarity to the pre-cutoff training actives, and the companion analysis
(external_novelty_strata.py) reports performance as a function of that distance. The question worth
answering is not whether the panel works on later chemistry but whether it works on later chemistry
that does not resemble what it was trained on.
