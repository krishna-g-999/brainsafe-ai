"""Adversarial (inversion) validation: try to break the model, confirm it holds.

Each check is written as a way the tool could be wrong; a PASS means that failure mode is absent.

  1. Leakage        no test compound is feature-identical to one in its training fold.
  2. Deduplication  no duplicate row survives into a model.
  3. Reproducible   retraining an endpoint with the fixed seed reproduces the reported score.
  4. Not trivial    predictions vary across compounds (the model is not a constant).
  5. Known answers  BBB ranks permeable approved drugs above non-permeable ones, on unseen compounds.
  6. Knows-its-limits  the domain flag separates non-drug-like chemistry from unseen drugs.

A check that cannot fail is worse than no check, because it is quoted as evidence. Four of these were
rewritten for that reason. Check 1 asserted that GroupKFold returns disjoint groups, which it
guarantees by contract; it now asks the question that matters, whether any test compound is
indistinguishable from a training one. Check 2 audited compound_library.csv, which no model trains
on, and so passed while the endpoint tables carried 13,846 feature-duplicate rows. Check 5 compared
two CNS compounds against two peripheral ones, n=4, one of them a training compound. Check 6 tested a
single molecule against a hard-coded cut.

Checks are not tuned until they pass. Check 6 currently FAILS, and that failure is a finding about
the applicability domain rather than a fault in the test: see docs and audit/FIXES.md.

    This used to check that GroupKFold produced disjoint groups, which it guarantees by contract, so
    it could not fail for any input. It also could not detect the defect that was present: the
    scaffold was computed on the raw SMILES while the features were computed on the desalted parent,
    so a salt and its free base were one input placed in different folds. The question worth asking
    is whether any test compound is indistinguishable from a training one, answered in feature space.

    It must be asked of the pipeline that produces the deployed model. A first version of this check
    split the raw endpoint table, while train_rf.py splits the table after collapsing rows that are
    byte-identical in feature space. The two differ, and once the measured negative class was
    recovered the difference became visible: the recovered rows include stereoisomers of compounds
    already present, so the raw table gained feature-duplicates and the check reported four of them
    in MAO_A as leakage into a model that never saw them. Both numbers are now reported, because the
    pre-deduplication figure is the leak that would exist if that step were removed.
