"""Integrity and reliability audit for a tool intended to displace wet-lab experiments.

Discrimination statistics such as AUROC answer whether a model ranks compounds correctly. They do
not answer the question a scientist actually faces, which is what happens if they act on a number.
Acting wrongly is not symmetric or free: a false positive spends animals, money and months on a
compound that was never going to work, and a false negative discards a real drug. This audit is
therefore organised around decisions rather than around rankings.

  A. Determinism. Identical input must give identical output, or nothing downstream is reproducible.

  B. Calibration. A stated probability is a promise about long-run frequency. If the tool says 80%
     it must be right about 80% of the time, otherwise the number cannot be used to weigh an
     experiment. Reported as expected calibration error and Brier score against held-out measured
     inactives, which is the only negative set with experimental authority.

  C. Decision analysis. Precision at the deployed threshold under realistic screening prevalence,
     with the number of wasted experiments per true hit made explicit. AUROC is prevalence-free;
     a laboratory is not.

  D. Leakage. Verify directly that the scaffold hold-out contained no training scaffold, rather
     than trusting that the splitting code did what it claimed.
