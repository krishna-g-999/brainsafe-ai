"""Does prospective accuracy survive when the test compound does not resemble the training set?

A time split is the right way to build an external set from retrospective data, and it flatters any
field that publishes analogue series. Medicinal chemistry publishes little else. If the compounds
appearing after a cutoff are close relatives of those before it, a high prospective AUROC shows that
the panel interpolates within a series, which is worth something but is not the claim a server makes
to someone submitting a new scaffold.

The single number therefore has to be broken open. Every test compound in the prospective and
cross-provenance runs carries its maximum Tanimoto similarity to the training actives of its own
split. Binning on that distance and recomputing performance within each bin answers the question the
aggregate hides: how far from the training set can a compound sit before the panel stops working?

Both classes are binned, so each stratum compares actives against measured inactives at a comparable
distance from training. Stratifying only the actives would produce bins whose positives are novel and
whose negatives are not, and the AUROC of such a bin would measure that mismatch instead of the
model. Pooling across endpoints is necessary for power, and it is a real limitation: an endpoint with
many novel test compounds contributes more to the far bins than one with few.

The bins are the conventional medicinal-chemistry reading of an ECFP Tanimoto, and were fixed before
the numbers were computed:

  below 0.40   a different chemotype; the applicability-domain flag would call this out of domain
  0.40 - 0.55  a related series, recognisably not the same one
  0.55 - 0.70  the same series, different substitution
  0.70 and up  a close analogue of something already in the training set
