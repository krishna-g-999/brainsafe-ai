"""Cross-provenance validation: does the panel survive a change of curator?

The time split (external_prospective.py) holds out the future. It cannot hold out a laboratory, and
a model can be prospectively accurate while depending on the habits of one curation pipeline:
ChEMBL's assay selection, its pChEMBL derivation, its choice of which papers to abstract. A second
kind of independence is available in this data and is worth measuring separately.

Every measured row carries the database it came from. Most rows are ChEMBL; some are present in both
ChEMBL and BindingDB; and a few thousand were deposited in BindingDB and are absent from ChEMBL
entirely. Those last are curated by different people, from different papers, under a different
protocol for deciding what counts as a measurement. Training on the ChEMBL side and testing on the
BindingDB-only side therefore asks a question the time split cannot: is the signal a property of the
chemistry, or of one database's way of recording it?

What this test can and cannot say, stated before the numbers rather than after:

  It cannot report AUROC. Every BindingDB-only row at every endpoint is an active. BindingDB
  deposits affinities, so a compound absent from ChEMBL and present in BindingDB is a compound
  someone measured and found to bind. There are no independently curated negatives to rank against,
  and inventing them from the background pool would test the background pool.

  It therefore reports recall at the deployed operating point, paired with the false-positive rate
  that same threshold produces on the background evaluation pool. Recall alone is meaningless: a
  model answering "active" to everything scores 1.0. Recall at a measured false-positive rate is a
  real statement, and it is the same pair the deployed panel reports.

  Recall is also reported against how far each test compound sits from the training chemistry, for
  the same reason as in the time split. A BindingDB-only compound from the same paper series as a
  ChEMBL one is not independent evidence however different its provenance.

The models are refitted on ChEMBL-provenance rows alone. Rows marked as present in both databases
count as ChEMBL and train; only BindingDB-only rows are held out.
