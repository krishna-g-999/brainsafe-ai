"""Pre-flight check on the deployed application.

Runs the checks that a browser session cannot make cheaply and that silently break a web server:
every declared import resolves, every model file the app asks for exists and loads, every artefact
referenced by the results panels is present, the knowledge graph is internally consistent, and a set
of chemically diverse compounds produces distinct and plausible output rather than one answer
repeated. The last of these exists because a shared answer across unrelated compounds was a real
defect once and would not raise an exception if it returned.

Exit status is 0 only if every check passes, so this can gate a deployment.

Run it with the interpreter that actually serves the application, not whichever Python happens to be
first on the path, or the version check will report drift that the deployed environment does not
have:
