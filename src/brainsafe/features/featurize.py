"""Turn a molecular structure into the numeric feature vector the models train on.

Every model input is numeric. A SMILES string is not fed to the model directly; it is converted
into two blocks of numbers:

  1. A 1024-bit ECFP-4 fingerprint (Morgan, radius 2). Each bit is 0/1 and records the presence of
     a particular local atomic environment. This is a collision-free-by-construction numeric
     encoding of substructure: bit k always means the same environment for every compound.
  2. Twelve interpretable physicochemical descriptors (molecular weight, logP, polar surface area,
     H-bond donors/acceptors, rotatable bonds, aromatic rings, sp3 fraction, ring count, heavy-atom
     count, formal charge, drug-likeness QED).

The result is a fixed 1036-length numeric vector with stable, named columns, identical for every
endpoint, so nothing categorical or free-text ever reaches the estimator.

Any categorical metadata that is *not* a model feature (endpoint name, assay source) is encoded
separately and reversibly in encodings.py; it is never mixed into this feature matrix.

    """The largest fragment of a structure, desalted, neutralised and sanitised.

    Public because the scaffold grouping in training must desalt exactly as this does, or a salt
    and its free base become identical inputs assigned to different cross-validation folds.

    Neutralisation is not cosmetic. Stripping the counter-ion without it left the parent carrying
    the charge the salt gave it, so haloperidol hydrochloride written the way PubChem serves it,
    with a protonated amine and a chloride, scored BBB 0.613 against 0.993 for the free base and
    hERG 0.295 against 0.914. A user who pasted the salt form lost a cardiac liability flag on a
    compound that has one. The two forms are the same drug and must give the same answer.

    What is neutralised is only what a proton can move: a carboxylate becomes an acid, a protonated
    amine becomes an amine. A permanent charge is left alone, because it is real chemistry rather
    than an artefact of how a depositor wrote the structure. Choline and neostigmine keep their
    quaternary nitrogen and their +1, which is exactly the property that stops such compounds
    crossing the barrier; erasing it would teach the model that they should. `formal_charge` stays
    a descriptor and now means "permanently charged" rather than "however this row was written".

    Measured over the training library before it was adopted: of 170,617 unique structures, 198
    (0.12 per cent) change representation and 1,155 charged ones are correctly left untouched. The
    panel was retrained afterwards so that training and inference share this representation.
