"""Precompute the read-across index: measured compounds, their fingerprints, and what they hit.

When no model fires, the measured library still holds evidence about the query. This index maps
every compound that is a measured active at one or more modelled targets to the set of those
targets, alongside an ECFP-4 fingerprint, so the server can answer "the closest measured compounds
to your query are actives at X and Y" for any structure.

This is read-across, which is weaker evidence than a validated model and fails at activity cliffs
where a single substitution abolishes binding. The similarity is therefore always carried alongside
the claim so the user can judge it, and the interface must phrase the result as a statement about
neighbours rather than about the query.
