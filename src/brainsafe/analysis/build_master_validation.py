"""Regenerate the headline validation table from the deployed state.

This table carries the numbers most likely to be quoted from the manuscript, and until now it was
maintained by hand. It had drifted to describe 39 targets when 46 have hold-out twins, which is
exactly the failure the provenance audit exists to catch and which the audit itself missed because
the file was not on its list. Both are fixed: the table is derived, and it is added to the audit.

Every figure traces to a file rather than to a recollection:

  prospective sensitivity   models_rf/holdout/binder_modes.json, the scaffold hold-out twins, where
                            a held-out compound shares no Bemis-Murcko scaffold with anything its
                            model saw
  specificity               results/tables/noncns_specificity_summary.csv, compounds with no measured
                            activity at any modelled target. They are presumed inactive rather than
                            proven so, which makes this a lower bound and it is labelled as one
  deployed specificity      results/deployed_specificity_audit.csv, the false-positive rate of the
                            served models on structures drawn at random from PubChem

Targets whose hold-out threshold collapsed to the permitted floor are excluded from the pooled
recall, because a threshold at the floor means no separation from background chemistry was achieved
and a recall computed against it is meaningless rather than merely poor.
