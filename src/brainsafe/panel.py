"""The panel: one place that says what this server is made of.

Every defect this module exists to prevent has the same shape. A script keeps its own idea of what
the panel contains, the panel changes, the script's idea does not, and nothing fails. It printed
DONE. Found in one audit:

  train_binders_hybrid.py         a hardcoded list of 37 names while 44 endpoints used its mode
  train_measured_label_holdout.py a hardcoded list of 2 names while 8 endpoints used its mode
  binder_cv_per_fold.py           a resume cache keyed on endpoint name, so after a retrain it
                                  reported the previous panel's cross-validation as complete
  apply_specificity_decisions.py  a hardcoded withdrawal list, applied whatever the models now do
  Makefile `train`                omitted one of the two binder trainers entirely

Between them, `make train` refitted 39 of 52 binders and said nothing, and a withdrawn endpoint that
had recovered would have stayed withdrawn for ever.

The fix is not more lists. It is that there is exactly one list, derived from the artefacts, and that
a caller states what it intends to cover and is checked against it.

Three independent views of the panel exist on disk, and the useful work of this module is
reconciling them rather than trusting any one:

  data/endpoints/*.csv        what there is data for
  models_rf/*_binder.joblib   what was actually fitted
  models_rf/binder_modes.json what the panel claims about itself

`verify()` compares all three and reports every disagreement, including a model older than the table
it was fitted from. That single check is what turns a silent partial retrain into a loud one.

Read-only. Nothing here writes, so it can be called from anywhere, including a test.

Run:  python src/brainsafe/panel.py          # print the reconciliation
