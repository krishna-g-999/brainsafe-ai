"""Figure T2. The two transforms that are easiest to misread: enrichment, and the exposure gate.

Chapter 7 argues both in prose. Neither has ever been drawn, and both are geometric statements that a
picture settles faster than a paragraph.

A. The enrichment map. A calibrated probability is converted to a signed distance from the endpoint's
   own base rate, positive above and negative below, so that 0.60 at an endpoint where 24 per cent of
   compounds are active and 0.60 at one where 86 per cent are mean opposite things. The map is
   piecewise linear with a kink at p = b, and the three curves are drawn at three real base rates
   from the deployed panel rather than at round numbers.
B. Why that matters here. The eight core base rates span 0.2363 to 0.8621, so a single probability
   threshold applied across the panel would be a different question at every endpoint.
C. The gate cannot change a disease ranking. Multiplying the fourteen non-peripheral conditions by
   the same barrier probability is a common positive scaling, and a common positive scaling is
   rank-invariant. Donepezil's conditions are drawn at three values of the gate; the bars shrink
   together and the order never changes. This is H3, refuted by construction.
D. The exception no document in the project states. Migraine and multiple sclerosis are exempt from
   the gate, because their mechanisms act outside the barrier. For those two the multiplier is 1
   while the other fourteen are scaled, so the gate does change the ordering across that boundary.
   Teriflunomide is the case: a DHODH inhibitor used in multiple sclerosis, with a barrier
   probability of 0.560 that its own condition never sees.

Every number is computed by importing app and scoring the structures.

# Panel A's three curves are the same function at three base rates, so base rate is a magnitude and

# figure set's EXPOSURE, TARGET and BINDER hues, which was wrong twice over. It spent three semantic
# colours on three endpoints that all belong to the same family, and the palette validator scores the
# TARGET-EXPOSURE pair at a normal-vision Delta E of 11.3, below the floor of 15, so a reader with
# ordinary colour vision would struggle to tell the teal curve from the blue one. Each step here is
# at least 3:1 against white, and each curve is also labelled at its own kink, so identity never
