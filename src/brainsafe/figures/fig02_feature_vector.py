"""Figure 2. What the estimator is actually given, computed for a real molecule.

Reviewers asked, reasonably, what the input to these models is. The answer is a fixed-length numeric
vector, and this figure shows it for donepezil rather than describing it: the structure, the
substructure environments that set bits, the 1,024-bit fingerprint drawn as a grid with the set bits
marked, and the twelve descriptors with their computed values.

The figure also states the two properties of this representation that a reader should hold on to,
because both bound what the models can do. Folding means a bit is not a unique substructure. Leaving
chirality out means two enantiomers are one row, which is why the deduplication step exists at all.

Everything is computed here by the same featuriser the models use, imported rather than reimplemented.
