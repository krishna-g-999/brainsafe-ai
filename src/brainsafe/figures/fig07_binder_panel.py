"""Figure 7. The binder panel, all 52 endpoints, including the ones that do not work.

The panel is not uniform and a single mean over it would hide that. These classifiers answer "does
this compound bind this target" for targets whose evidence ranges from thousands of measured actives
with hundreds of measured non-binders, to a few dozen actives and almost no measured negatives at
all. Performance tracks that, and the figure is ordered so it can be read off.

Panel A places every endpoint by what it discriminates and what it recovers. Panel B lists all of
them, so a reader can look up any target rather than take a panel average on trust, with the five
withdrawn endpoints and the ones that fail the reliability gate marked rather than omitted.

An endpoint is withdrawn when no threshold can simultaneously separate real ligands from unrelated
chemistry, hold the background false-positive rate to target and retain usable sensitivity. Most fail
by firing on trivial metabolites; others fail on discrimination alone. Either is a property of the
fitted model, found by testing it against chemistry it should reject, and it is reported here rather
than being quietly dropped.
