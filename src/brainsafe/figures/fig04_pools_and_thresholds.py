"""Figure 4. Where the negatives come from, and why the threshold is set on one pool and measured
on another.

A binder classifier needs negatives, and for most targets almost none are published: a paper reports
what bound, not what did not. The panel therefore trains against property-matched decoys drawn from
a background library, and that creates the failure this figure is about. If the decision threshold
is chosen as a quantile of a sample and the false-positive rate is then computed on that same sample,
the rate cannot exceed the quantile. It is a restatement of the target, not a measurement of it.

The background library is split into three disjoint pools by a stable hash of the structure, so a
compound's pool never depends on run order and no compound appears in two. Decoys are drawn from the
first, thresholds are set on the second, and the false-positive rate is measured on the third.

Panel C is the evidence the fix took: measured on a pool it was not set on, the background
false-positive rate now exceeds its 0.05 target for some endpoints, which under the old procedure
was arithmetically impossible.

Reads models_rf/binder_modes.json, results/tables/background_specificity_disjoint.csv, and the pool
sizes from models.pools.
