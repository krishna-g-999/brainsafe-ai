"""Figure 10: the evidence behind which targets became endpoints and which did not.

The question this answers is the one asked of any panel: why these targets and not others. The
honest answer has two halves, and only one of them is about biology.

The biological half is stated in the manuscript: each axis is present because CNS attrition happens
on it. That is a literature argument and no figure can settle it.

The half a figure *can* settle is the second: a target only becomes an endpoint if the measured data
can support a model that survives a scaffold split, and if the fitted model can then be given a
threshold that finds actives without firing on unrelated chemistry. Those are measurable conditions,
they were applied uniformly, and they rejected targets that were wanted on mechanism. This figure
shows where those conditions bite.

  A  data volume against what the model achieves, over the whole panel, so the reader can see the
     relationship rather than take the bar on trust
  B  the condition that actually decides deployment, which is not AUROC but whether a usable
     threshold exists, and the endpoints that failed it despite ranking well
  C  the same bar applied to 1,688 surveyed candidate targets, showing how few clear it
