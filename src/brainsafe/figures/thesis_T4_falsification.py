"""Figure T4. The falsification suite: ten hypotheses stated so that they could fail.

Every other result in this project was produced by someone who wanted the tool to work. This suite
assumes each central claim is false and asks what evidence would prove it, pairing every hypothesis
with a null model capable of producing the same apparent success by accident. Four of the ten were
refuted and two weakened, and the refutations are the most valuable output: they cost the project a
claim about the knowledge graph, a claim about the exposure gate, a change to the interface, and four
withdrawn endpoints.

A. The ten verdicts, with the hypothesis stated as it was posed rather than as it turned out.
B. The leakage null. With labels permuted, the same pipeline on the same Bemis-Murcko folds returns
   chance on all sixteen endpoint-split combinations, against true AUROCs a third of a unit higher.
   The scaffold null matters most: whole scaffold classes could in principle carry enough
   class-frequency information for a label-free model to exploit the grouping, and they do not.
C. H10, the hypothesis the suite lacked until a thesis audit named the gap. The barrier model is the
   component the architecture is named for. Against descriptor rules and descriptor-only models on
   241 approved drugs it has never seen, the paired bootstrap interval for its margin crosses zero,
   which is why the verdict reads WEAKENED and not SUPPORTED.
