"""Add a background-specificity requirement to every binder threshold.

A prospective test exposed a failure mode that per-target validation had missed. Nav1.1 was trained
on its own measured actives and inactives, both of which are sodium-channel screening chemistry, and
scored an AUROC of 0.979 against that narrow negative set. Presented with arbitrary chemistry it
assigned glucose a binder probability of 0.806, because nothing in its training ever showed it what
an unrelated molecule looks like. A model validated only against its own assay's negatives can be
confidently wrong about everything else.

The threshold is therefore required to satisfy two conditions simultaneously:

  1. no more than TARGET_FPR of the target's held-out measured inactives is called a binder, and
  2. no more than BACKGROUND_FPR of a random sample of the measured compound library is called a
     binder, which bounds how often the model fires on unrelated chemistry. The level is set at 5%:
     tightening it to 2% was tested and rejected because it cost too much sensitivity, pushing the
     mu-opioid threshold to 0.999 and causing morphine to be missed.

The operating threshold is the stricter of the two. Sensitivity is then re-measured at that
threshold and a target is marked unreliable if too few genuine binders survive. Targets that cannot
satisfy both conditions while retaining useful sensitivity are reported so they can be excluded
rather than silently trusted.
