"""Compute a second, high-precision threshold set for low-prevalence screening.

The integrity audit showed that the deployed operating point, sensitivity 0.90 at a background
false-positive rate of 0.125, gives a precision of only 7% when real actives are around one in a
hundred: roughly fourteen wasted experiments per true hit. That is the regime in which a diverse
library is triaged, and it is precisely where a tool meant to spare animals and reagents would
instead consume them.

Precision at fixed prevalence is governed by the false-positive rate, so a second threshold set is
calibrated against an independent background sample at SCREENING_FPR rather than the default. The
cost is sensitivity, which is measured here rather than assumed, so a user choosing the stricter
mode knows what fraction of true actives it forfeits.

Both threshold sets are stored. Neither is a correction of the other: triage thresholds suit a
focused or enriched set where recall matters, screening thresholds suit a large diverse library
where a false positive is expensive.

Writes the screening_threshold field into models_rf/binder_modes.json and
results/tables/screening_thresholds.csv
