"""Retrain the remaining measured-label models with a held-out inactive split.

SIRT1 and Nav1.5 have too few binders at pChEMBL >= 7 for the hybrid binder scheme, so they are
trained on the measured activity label instead (active at pChEMBL >= 6, inactive below 5). In the
earlier pass these models were evaluated on the full set of measured inactives, including the ones
used to fit them, which inflates their apparent performance. Half the measured inactives are now
withheld from training and used for validation and threshold calibration.

That alone was not enough, and this docstring previously claimed more than the code delivered. Every
positive still entered training and sensitivity was still reported on all of them, so the figure
measured recall of memorised compounds. A fifth of the active scaffold groups is now withheld too,
and sensitivity is reported on those, matching the hybrid binder panel so the numbers are
comparable.
