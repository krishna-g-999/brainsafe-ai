"""Recompress the deployed models, verifying that not one prediction changes.

The model directory is 1.8 GB, which is the real obstacle to deployment: it exceeds GitHub's free
large-file quota, makes any container image slow to build and push, and is why the repository tracks
64 metadata files and no binaries at all. A clone therefore cannot run the server, which is a worse
problem than not having a URL.

Most of that size is avoidable. The binder models were written with compression; the calibrated
classifiers and the regressors were not, and the largest is 148 MB where 44 MB carries the same
object. Compression here is lossless in the exact sense that matters: joblib stores the same arrays,
so predictions are bit-identical, and this script proves that per model rather than assuming it.

The rule is strict. Every model is loaded, recompressed, reloaded, and scored on a fixed probe set.
If a single probability differs by any amount at all, the original is kept and the failure reported.
Originals are moved aside rather than deleted, so the operation is reversible until verified.

Writes models_rf/*.joblib in place, and results/model_compression.csv
