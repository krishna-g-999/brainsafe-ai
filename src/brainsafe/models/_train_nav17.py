"""Train the Nav1.7 binder model.

This was a verbatim copy of train_binders_hybrid.py differing only in its target list, which meant
every correction to the training procedure had to be made in three places or silently applied to two
thirds of the panel. It is kept as an entry point because it is the only recorded way Nav1_7_binder.joblib was produced, but it now delegates rather than
duplicating: the parent already accepts targets on the command line.

Equivalent to:  python src/brainsafe/models/train_binders_hybrid.py Nav1_7
