"""Set every binder decision threshold from two independent requirements, computed from scratch.

Requirement A, selectivity against tested non-binders: at most TARGET_FPR of the target's measured
inactives may be called a binder. Only the half withheld at training time counts, read from
models_rf/holdout/<T>_binder_holdout.json. This step used to re-read every inactive in the endpoint
table, including the half the model was fitted on, which undid the holdout that training had
constructed and set the threshold on 40 of 49 deployed endpoints from data the model had seen.

Requirement B, specificity against unrelated chemistry: at most BACKGROUND_FPR of the threshold pool
may be called a binder. That pool is disjoint from the decoys the model trained on and from the
evaluation pool the reported rate is measured on, so neither the threshold nor the rate is a
restatement of the other. It exists because a prospective test found Nav1.1 assigning glucose a
binder probability of 0.806 while scoring 0.979 against its own assay's negatives: a model judged
only on its own chemistry can be confidently wrong about everything else.

The operating threshold is the stricter of the two, recomputed from scratch each run so repeated
calibration cannot ratchet thresholds upward. BACKGROUND_FPR is 0.05; 0.02 was tested and rejected
because it drove the mu-opioid threshold to 0.999 and caused morphine to be missed.
