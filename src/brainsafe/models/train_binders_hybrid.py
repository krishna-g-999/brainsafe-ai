"""Hybrid retraining: property-matched decoys PLUS experimentally measured inactives.

Decoy-only training has a specific failure mode. Because the negatives are chosen to be structurally
dissimilar, the model becomes over-confident and saturates: for melatonin MT1 the measured inactives
score a median binder probability of 0.972 against an active median of 0.997, so the decision
boundary sits in a region where tiny probability differences swing the result. Sensitivity at a
controlled false-positive rate then collapses (MT1 0.52, KEAP1 0.33).

The fix is to give the model the hard negatives it never saw. Measured inactives (compounds tested
against the target and found inactive) are split in half: one half joins the training negatives
alongside the decoys, the other half is held out and used for unbiased validation and for setting
the decision threshold. Positives remain measured binders at pChEMBL >= 7.

Every model is scaffold-grouped 10-fold cross-validated, then refit and calibrated.

What is withheld, and why each number comes from a different place. Actives are split by scaffold and
a fifth of the scaffold groups never enter training, so sensitivity is measured on structurally
distinct compounds rather than on recall of the training set. Measured inactives are split in half,
one half training as hard negatives and the other setting the threshold. Decoys are drawn only from
the decoy pool, and the target's own measured inactives are excluded from decoy eligibility, so a
compound cannot be both a trained negative and an unseen one. The false-positive rate is reported on
the evaluation pool, which is disjoint from both: measuring it on the sample the threshold quantile
came from returns that quantile whatever the model does.

Both halves of every split are written to models_rf/holdout/<T>_binder_holdout.json, so a later
threshold step cannot reach past the holdout by re-reading the endpoint table.

Outputs models_rf/<T>_binder.joblib and refreshed binder_modes.json entries.
