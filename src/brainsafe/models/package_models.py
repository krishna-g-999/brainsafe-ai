"""Package the deployed models as one archive, with a manifest that can verify it.

The model binaries are 0.78 GB and are excluded from the repository by .gitignore, so a clone cannot
run the server. Carrying them in git-lfs works on a host that provides the storage, but it ties the
deployment to that host and consumes the GitHub free quota outright. Publishing them once as a
citable archive and fetching at start-up instead makes the server deployable anywhere, and gives the
manuscript something to cite that is not a directory on a laptop.

The manifest is the point. It records the archive's SHA-256 and the size and checksum of every file
inside it, so a download can be verified rather than trusted: a truncated transfer or a silently
substituted archive is caught before a single model is loaded, instead of surfacing later as a
prediction that is subtly wrong. The manifest is small and is committed to the repository; the
archive is not.

Writes models_manifest.json and dist/brainsafe_models_v<version>.tar.gz
