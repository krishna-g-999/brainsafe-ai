"""Act on the deployed-specificity audit.

The audit (results/deployed_specificity_audit.csv) scores every binder model at its calibrated
threshold against 600 random PubChem structures and against molecules no CNS target plausibly binds:
glucose, urea, acetate, ethanol, glycine, lactate, atenolol. A model that calls urea a sodium-channel
binder is not a marginal calibration issue, it is a false-positive generator inside a tool whose
purpose is to stop laboratories spending money on compounds that will not work.

Every decision here is re-derived from that audit whenever the models change, never inherited. A
withdrawal is a claim about a particular fit, and the panel has been refitted; carrying a decision
across a retrain would assert something about estimators that no longer exist. Re-deriving it after
the neutralised-representation retrain moved two entries and emptied a third category:

  Nav1_1     WITHDRAWN, as before but for freshly measured reasons. It fires on glucose, urea,
             glycine, lactate and atenolol at its calibrated threshold of 0.571, at a
             random-chemistry false-positive rate of 0.080. Holding 5 per cent would need 0.594,
             and sensitivity at the calibrated cut is already 0.120, so no cut separates a
             metabolite from a sodium-channel ligand. Its AUROC of 0.952 measures ranking, which is
             not the quantity a deployed threshold needs. Nav1.6 covers the axonal sodium-channel
             mechanism instead.

  GluA2      WITHDRAWN, and this is new: it passed before. It now fires on glucose and atenolol at
             a calibrated 0.629, reaching 0.719 on a trivial molecule, with a random-chemistry rate
             of 0.072 and a sensitivity of 0.103.

  Cav3_2     REINSTATED. It was rejected for an active band compressed near zero, a calibrated
             threshold of 0.065 and atenolol scoring 0.084 above it. On the refit the threshold is
             0.370, the highest any trivial control reaches is 0.048, random chemistry is 0.000, and
             it scores AUROC 0.982 at sensitivity 0.975. The compression belonged to the old fit,
             not to the target, and withholding it now would be an inherited decision rather than a
             measured one.

  NRF2       WITHDRAWN, natural-product coverage; random chemistry 0.057, above the 5 per cent the
  NFKB1      panel holds to, and NFKB1 fires on five trivial metabolites at sensitivity 0.000 while
  NR3C1      NR3C1 fails on discrimination instead, at AUROC 0.410 against its own held-out measured
             inactives. Reasons and evidence per endpoint are in WITHDRAW below.

  no         RETHRESHOLDING. All three overrides (a3b4nAChR 0.450, SIRT1 0.650, RIPK1 0.500) were
  overrides  removed: each was a remedy for an observation that does not reproduce on the current
             fits, and every one of the three now passes the audit at its calibrated threshold. An
             override whose justification has expired silently costs sensitivity.

#
#   a3b4nAChR  calibrated 0.279; no trivial control fires; the highest any reaches is 0.193, and
#              ethanol, which drove the original raise to 0.450, is below it. Random-chemistry
#              false-positive rate 0.012.
#   SIRT1      calibrated 0.465; random-chemistry false-positive rate 0.033, already under the 5 per
#              cent the raise to 0.650 was meant to restore. No trivial control fires.
#   RIPK1      calibrated 0.050, the permitted floor; the highest probability any trivial control
