"""Calibrate each binder model's decision threshold against EXPERIMENTALLY MEASURED inactives.

Validation against measured inactives (compounds tested against the same target and found inactive)
shows that the binder models rank correctly, with a mean AUROC of 0.936 and no endpoint below 0.70.
It also shows that the default 0.5 probability threshold is far too permissive on real chemistry:
for several targets a majority of measured inactives exceed it, because the property-matched decoys
used in training are easier to reject than genuine tested non-binders.

Ranking is therefore trustworthy while the absolute cut is not. This script replaces the fixed cut
with a per-target threshold chosen so that a stated fraction of measured inactives (default 10%) is
called a binder. Targets without enough measured inactives keep the global fallback and are marked
as such, so the interface can say which basis was used.

Writes models_rf/binder_modes.json with, per target: mode, base rate where applicable, the
calibrated threshold, the measured-inactive AUROC and the achieved false-positive rate.
