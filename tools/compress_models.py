"""Recompress the model files, verifying that predictions are unchanged.

The panel is 2.12 GB on disk, and most of that is not information. joblib writes an uncompressed
pickle unless asked otherwise: the binder models were dumped with compress=3 and average 3 MB, while
the eight calibrated core classifiers were dumped without and average 117 MB. hERG_calibrated alone
is 200 MB and holds five complete 300-tree forests, because CalibratedClassifierCV(cv=5) keeps one
per fold. Those five are not redundant, so they stay; what is redundant is storing them raw.

Size matters here for one reason. A 2 GB panel cannot be hosted on any free tier, and a server that
is not reachable is not a web server. Compression is the one lever that costs nothing scientifically.

Nothing is trusted. Every file is recompressed to a temporary path, reloaded, and scored on a fixed
pseudorandom matrix against the original; the file is only replaced if the predictions agree to
1e-12. That tolerance is not arbitrary and is not slack: a random forest with n_jobs=-1 sums tree
votes in completion order, so calling one estimator twice already differs by around 1e-16. The same
tolerance is pinned in tests/test_integration_smoke.py for the same reason.

A file that fails verification is left exactly as it was and reported, so a partial run degrades to
"fewer files compressed" rather than to a panel that predicts differently.

Run:  python tools/compress_models.py            # report what would be saved, change nothing
      python tools/compress_models.py --apply    # recompress in place, verifying each file
