"""Convert the supplementary technical documents to Word, in the same style as the manuscript.

These are the companion documents a PI or reviewer reads alongside the manuscript itself:
DATA_MANIFEST.md, ENDPOINT_JUSTIFICATION.md, METHODS.md, VALIDATION.md and decisions_log.md. They
previously existed only as Markdown; converting them with the same reference template used for the
manuscript (docs/nar_manuscript_reference.docx: Times New Roman, single-spaced, continuous line
numbers, no table of contents) means the whole packet sent out reads as one document set rather than
as a manuscript in one style and its evidence in another.

TECHNICAL_REPORT.md is not included here: it has its own converter
(src/brainsafe/analysis/technical_report_docx.py) because it embeds rendered flowcharts.

Run:  python tools/build_supplementary_docx.py
