Every data file behind the deployed panel, what it contains, and how it was made. All values are
measured (ChEMBL 37, BindingDB, B3DB, Therapeutics Data Commons, MoleculeNet, NPASS 3.0); nothing is
imputed. Regenerate any file by running the script named beside it. Counts below are read live by
`tools/build_data_manifest.py` and reflect the repository as of {today}.

This replaces an earlier version of this document built around `data/processed/compound_library.csv`,
a 61,317-compound, thirteen-endpoint snapshot from before the panel grew to its current scope. That
file and the scripts that built it (`src/brainsafe/data/build_compound_library.py`,
`src/brainsafe/viz/make_figures.py`) still exist on disk but are no longer part of the deployed
pipeline; nothing below points to them.

## The training data

- **`data/endpoints/<TARGET>.csv`** ({n_endpoint_files} files) - one file per target: the core
  target-potency and activity endpoints, the binder panel (including withdrawn endpoints, kept
  rather than deleted), and blood-brain-barrier labels. Columns: `smiles, label, pchembl, year,
  source`, where `source` records ChEMBL, BindingDB, or `ChEMBL_inactive` for a censored bound
  recovered as a measured non-binder. These are exactly what each model is trained and tested on.
- **`data/adme/<ENDPOINT>.csv`** ({n_adme_files} files) - the nine ADME and exposure endpoints
  beyond BBB (Caco-2 permeability, hepatocyte clearance, unbound brain-to-plasma ratio,
  lipophilicity, logBB, P-glycoprotein inhibition and substrate status, plasma-protein binding,
  aqueous solubility).
- Together, the **{facts['n_endpoint_tables']} tables behind currently deployed models** hold
  **{facts['n_records']:,} measured compound-endpoint records**, a median of
  {facts['rows_median']:,} rows per table (range {facts['rows_min']:,} to {facts['rows_max']:,}).
- **Unique compounds.** {uniq_note['distinct SMILES strings across the endpoint tables'][0]:,}
  distinct SMILES strings appear across the endpoint tables, of which
  {uniq_note['of which parent_mol() could not parse'][0]} could not be parsed. The remaining
  strings collapse to **{uniq_note['distinct InChIKeys of the desalted, neutralised parent'][0]:,}
  distinct InChIKeys** of the desalted, neutralised parent
  ({uniq_note['SMILES strings collapsed by this standardisation'][0]:,} SMILES strings were salts,
  tautomers or charge states of a compound already counted) — this is the compound count the
  manuscript's training-data paragraph states.
  Computed by `src/brainsafe/evaluation/unique_compound_count.py`;
  full breakdown in `results/tables/unique_compound_count.csv`.
- **Provenance per endpoint** (how many compounds from each source, actives/inactives):
  `results/tables/endpoint_rebuild_provenance.csv`.
- **Recovery of the negative class from censored bounds**, and its effect on class balance per
  endpoint: `results/tables/expansion_inactives.csv`, built by
  `src/brainsafe/data/recover_expansion_inactives.py`.
- **The actual numeric input every model trains on.** A SMILES string and a label are what the
  endpoint tables above store; the 1,036-column vector a model actually receives
  (`src/brainsafe/features/featurize.py`) is computed on the fly and was not previously written to
  any file. `results/tables/master_feature_vectors.csv` (one row per distinct compound, keyed by
  InChIKey) and `results/tables/master_training_usage.csv` (one row per endpoint-compound pair
  actually used, joinable to the vectors on `inchikey`) make it inspectable directly, built by
  `tools/build_master_training_vectors.py`. Every formula that turns a vector into a reported score
  is walked through with a live worked example in `docs/ML_METHODS_AND_FORMULAS.md`.

## Cross-validation - all data saved

- **`results/tables/rf_cv_folds.csv`** / **`rf_cv_summary.csv`** - per-fold and summary metrics for
  the core target-potency, activity and exposure endpoints, ten folds under both a random split and
  a scaffold-grouped split (Bemis-Murcko).
- **`results/tables/binder_cv_folds.csv`** / **`binder_cv_summary.csv`** - the same for the
  binder panel, scaffold-grouped only, against measured inactives.
- **`results/tables/model_comparison.csv`** - the like-for-like comparison against XGBoost,
  histogram gradient boosting, logistic regression and nearest-neighbour read-across.

## Background specificity and applicability domain

- **`models_rf/ad_reference.pkl`** and **`src/brainsafe/models/pools.py`** - the background library,
  partitioned into three disjoint pools by a stable hash of the canonical structure (one supplies
  decoys, one sets thresholds, one measures the false-positive rate), so a compound's pool is a
  property of the molecule rather than of run order.
- **`results/tables/background_specificity_disjoint.csv`** - the background false-positive rate at
  the currently deployed threshold, measured on the evaluation pool, for every deployed binder
  endpoint. Built by `src/brainsafe/evaluation/background_specificity_disjoint.py`; this is the
  figure the manuscript's Methods section quotes.
- **`results/tables/inversion_validation.csv`** - the applicability-domain adversarial check.

## External and prospective validation (held out of training)

- **`results/tables/external_bbb_validation.csv`** - the barrier model against FDA-curated approved
  drugs absent from B3DB by InChIKey.
- **`results/tables/external_prospective.csv`** - every qualifying endpoint refitted on its
  pre-cutoff rows, decision threshold frozen before the cutoff, tested on compounds first published
  afterwards.
- **`results/tables/external_novelty_strata.csv`** - recall against maximum Tanimoto similarity to
  the training actives, across three independently built test sets (by date, at random, by curator).
- **`results/tables/external_natural_products_summary.csv`** - the three targets tested for
  natural-product coverage, and the endpoints where genuinely external NPASS data existed to score.

## Models

- **`models_rf/<TARGET>.joblib` / `<TARGET>_binder.joblib`** ({n_model_files} files) - the deployed
  estimators, refit on all available data after cross-validation.
- **`models_rf/<TARGET>_meta.json`** ({n_meta_files} files) - training size, positives, features,
  hyperparameters, calibration method.
- **`models_rf/binder_modes.json`** - the binder panel registry: threshold, AUROC and sensitivity
  against measured inactives, deployment status, and the recorded reason for every withdrawal.
- **`results/tables/MODEL_INVENTORY.csv`** - one row per trained estimator, family, task, training
  size, validation scheme, calibration, deployment status.
- **`models_manifest.json`** - SHA-256 checksum of every shipped model file, so a download is
  verified rather than trusted.

## Figures

- **`manuscript/figures/*.png`** (and `.pdf`) - built by the scripts in
  `src/brainsafe/figures/` ({len(fig_scripts)} scripts:
  {', '.join(s.replace('.py', '') for s in fig_scripts)}), each reading the results tables named in
  its own docstring rather than a value typed into the script. `style.py` in the same directory is
  the single shared colour palette, font and layout convention every figure uses.

## Falsification suite

- **`inversion/results/*.csv`** - the per-hypothesis evidence for the ten-hypothesis falsification
  suite (H1-H10).
- **`inversion/results/VERDICTS.csv`** - one verdict per hypothesis, computed from the CSVs above by
  `inversion/summarise.py` rather than asserted.
- **`inversion/REPORT.md`** - the falsification narrative.

## Provenance and decisions

- **`data/raw/measured_endpoints_SOURCE.md`** - every source, URL, filter, licence.
- **`docs/decisions_log.md`** - dated methodological decisions and the evidence behind each.
- **`docs/ENDPOINT_JUSTIFICATION.md`** - why these targets, and exactly how each endpoint's training
  and test values are obtained.
- **`docs/TECHNICAL_REPORT.md`** - the full methods and results narrative, of which this manifest
  and the endpoint justification are companion reference documents.
