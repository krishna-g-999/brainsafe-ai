"""Write the reviewer's entry point: every claim, its number, and the file that produced it.

An institutional reviewer is not being asked to trust the manuscript. They are being asked to confirm
that each number in it came from somewhere they can open. This generates that mapping from the
artefacts themselves, so a figure quoted here is the figure the file currently holds, and a claim
whose artefact has gone missing shows as missing rather than as prose.

## How to check any one of these

Every figure above is produced by a script in `05_CODE/`, and every script names its output in its
own docstring. To confirm a number, open the file named in the third column and read it; to confirm
that the file is current, `10_REPRODUCIBILITY/check_freshness.py` compares every artefact against the
inputs it was derived from and fails if any is older.

## What is deliberately not here

The fitted estimators are 0.85 GB and are omitted unless the package was built with `--with-models`.
`07_MODELS/models_manifest_with_checksums.json` lists every one of them with a SHA-256, so their
presence and integrity can be checked without shipping them. They are also public at
https://huggingface.co/spaces/Krishnag999/brainsafe-ai and
https://github.com/krishna-g-999/brainsafe-ai.

Raw API caches, the archived earlier versions of the project, and the Python virtual environment are
omitted. None is quoted anywhere and together they are several gigabytes.
