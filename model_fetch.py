"""Make sure the models are present before anything tries to load them.

The model binaries are 0.78 GB and are not in the repository, so a fresh clone or a container built
from it has the code and none of the science. This fetches them from a published archive on first
run, and does nothing at all when they are already there, which is the case on any developer machine
and on any host that bakes them into the image.

Verification is not optional here. A truncated download or a substituted archive would not announce
itself: the server would start, load whatever it found, and return predictions that are wrong in ways
no user could detect. Every file is therefore checked against the SHA-256 recorded in
models_manifest.json before the server is allowed to proceed, and a mismatch is fatal rather than a
warning.

Behaviour, in order:
  1. if models_manifest.json is absent, do nothing: this is a development tree that manages its own
     models, and inventing a fetch would be worse than leaving it alone
  2. if every file named in the manifest is present with the right size and checksum, do nothing
  3. otherwise download the archive from the first URL that works, verify it, extract, and verify
     every extracted file

Set BRAINSAFE_SKIP_MODEL_FETCH=1 to bypass entirely, for an image that already carries the models.
