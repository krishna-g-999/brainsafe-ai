"""The served panel must be the registered panel, and the graph must only name models that exist.

The panel registry reconciles three views: the endpoint tables, the fitted models, and the registry
itself. It does not see app.py, and that gap let a defect sit undetected. `BINDER_TARGETS` was a
hardcoded list and had drifted from the registry in both directions at once:

  GluA2  had been withdrawn from the panel and was still in the list, so it was still scored, still
         carried an Epilepsy edge in the knowledge graph at weight 0.6, and could therefore drive a
         reported condition from a model the project had judged unfit to deploy.
  Cav3_2 is deployed and validated and was absent from the list, so it was never scored at all.

Neither raised an error. Nothing in the freshness graph or the panel check could see either, because
both compare the registry against the models rather than against the code that serves them. These
tests close that gap from the other side.
