"""Invariants the scientific results depend on, each of which has been violated at least once.

These are not tests of "does the code run". Each one pins a property whose loss would change a
published number without raising an error, and most correspond to a defect the audit found:

  deduplication   collapses rows identical in feature space, drops contradictory groups rather than
                  voting on them, and does so BEFORE any split. Losing this reintroduces the leak
                  where a stereoisomer of a test compound sits in training.
  pools           the three background pools are disjoint and assignment is a pure function of the
                  structure, so a threshold set on one pool and measured on another stays honest
                  across runs and machines.
  label rule      a censored bound settles a label only when the whole interval lies on one side of
                  the cut. Feeding a bound to the exact-value rule silently discarded 253 measured
                  non-binders for AChE alone.
  determinism     the declared seed actually fixes the result.
