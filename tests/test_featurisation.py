"""The featuriser: the one component every model depends on.

If featurisation changes, every stored estimator becomes wrong without anything failing, because a
pickled forest will happily consume a vector of the right width and the wrong meaning. These tests
pin the properties the rest of the pipeline assumes:

  shape        1,036 columns, the same for every molecule, forever
  purity       a molecule's vector depends on that molecule and nothing else, not on what else is
               in the batch and not on input order
  parenting    salts are stripped and the largest organic fragment is used, so a salt and its free
               base give the same vector, which is why deduplication has to happen in feature space
  stereo       chirality is excluded, so enantiomers collide. This is a limitation, not an accident,
               and a test that pins it will fail loudly if someone "fixes" it without also changing
               the deduplication step that exists because of it
  determinism  the same input gives bit-identical output across calls
