"""Invariants of the external-validation programme.

The prospective validation is only meaningful if it mirrors the deployed training exactly. Its whole
claim is "the same panel, fitted to less time", so any constant that drifts between the trainer and
the validator turns the comparison into a comparison of two different pipelines while continuing to
report a number labelled as the cost of prospectivity. Nothing would raise an error. The reported
figure would simply stop meaning what the report says it means, which is the failure mode this
project keeps finding and the reason this file exists.

Three properties are pinned:

  mirrored constants  the validator's active cut, decoy ratio, similarity ceiling, target
                      false-positive rate and forest configuration are the trainer's.
  no temporal leak    the year split is by earliest recorded year per structure, so a compound
                      measured before and after the cutoff counts as known. Taking the latest year
                      instead would move known chemistry into the test set and inflate every result.
  band coverage       the novelty bands tile [0, 1] without gap or overlap, so no test compound is
                      counted twice or silently dropped from the stratification.
